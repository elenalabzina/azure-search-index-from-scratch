The prerequisite is a Microsoft Azure Subscription account.

- **main-create-azsearch-index-allsteps.ipynb** - covers the steps of creating your first Microsoft Cognitive Search Index
- **additional-create-index-schema.ipynb** - helps you create an index schema based on your JSON

The sample also shows how to add a semantic configuration that allows you to perform a semantic search. 

Good luck and have fun!
